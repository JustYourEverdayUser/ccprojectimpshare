-Day 1-
Adjusted well to new environment. Picked flowers and tried to form a currency based on them; idea was rejected by the group. Gave a few flowers to everyone anyway.
-Day 2-
Good relations with Foxy and Cassy. Constructed a house and decorated with flowers, made pop culture references. Voiced suspicion on the 'cult of the vines'.
-Day 3-
Made more pop culture references. Hung around with group until there was an attempt to climb the vines; resulted in his death.

-Additional Notes-
Staff found his name and demeaner rather amusing. Unfortunate he got himself killed so early.
