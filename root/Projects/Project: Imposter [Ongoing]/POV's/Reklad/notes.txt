-Day 1-
Was disturbed and mentally distant, but kept calm. Discovery of Jake's remains pushed him to find a useful role, and he took up farming. Formed good relations with Space and cheese.
-Day 2-
Minimal response to the discovery of the cave. Became concerned about Space's mental state. Strongly resisted the 'Cult of the Vines' whose members (excluding Jeremy) were caught eating from the bodies in the cave. Formed anti-cult group with Space, Cheese, and Cai. Group found weakspot in the walls but could not make any notable progress in damaging it.
-Day 3-
Tension towards the 'cult' fades, with interest in escape hightening. He managed to craft some stone tools, and with Space, continued to make attempts on the wall's weakspot. Failed to make any progress in this, which was intensely disturbing to Space, whom he managed to somewhat appease. He was one of the people to join Cheese in the climb. He was unable to prevent his fall/death, and seems to blame himself for it.
-Day 4-


-Additional Notes-
Having closer relations to Space than the others, they may serve to cataclyse each other's collapse.
