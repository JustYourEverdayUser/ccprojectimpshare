-Day 1-
Seemed unsure of how to respond to new circumstances. Was alone when he stumbled upon the remains of Jake. Young age and lack of past memories leave him vulnrable to further traumas.
-Day 2-
Seemed to interact with group more comfortable. Accident while mining for gravel led to the discovery of a sealed area. Experienced head-trauma of unknown severity which was not inspected. Insensitive behavior of Cassy in, and close confinement with two desicated corpses, had harsh effects on his psyche. Further interactions were avoided and non-verbal. Was confronted by Abby, who believed he was hiding a book from the group. Started construction on his house, with entrance positioned away from the center of the area.
-Day 3-
Continued construction until stone was necessary. Seemed reluctant to enter mine. Remained evasive until confronted by Foxy and others, who managed to coax him to communicate through signs. First communication was denying having the book; Abby's confrontation may have disturbed him more than it seemed. Group remained reassuring. Foxy and Cassy courced him to join the 'Believers of the Vines', which was widely concerning to the rest of the group.
-Day 4-
Showed significantly more excitement at seeing Foxy as to seeing Cassy. Likely prefers their presense as they are closer to his age and have a bright (if questionable) personality. Was one of those to witness Cheese's death. Seemed to try and convey his troubles to Foxy before being interupted by a distraught Space. Both attempted to calm Space. All of this seemed to distress him further; he fell asleep sitting at the group table with a blank expression.
-Day 5-

-Day 6-

-Day 7-


-Additional Notes-
His past, young age, exposure to gore, and overall developement has led to the request for his entries to be more detailed, and such has been done.
