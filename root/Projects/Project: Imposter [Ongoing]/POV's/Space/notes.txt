-Day 1-
Responded poorly to new environment, avoiding group until an attempt at gathering everyone was made. Meeting was interupted by Jeremy's discovery of Jake's remains. He disengaged with the group immediately after and began constructing his treehouse. Stabilized but was still worried.
-Day 2-
Woke up distressed, likely had a nightmare. Meets with the group, which is also interupted by Jeremy's second discovery. He isolates again; it is clear by now that things are taking a toll. Breaks down in front of Abby. Eventually calms down and sleeps.
-Day 3-
He obsessively goes over a book left behind by one of the victims of the cave, disturbing himself further. Rek convinces him to get rid of the book. Witnessing Cheese's death first-hand unraveled him further. Mentally breaks in front of Foxy and Jeremy, who manage to help him in the short-term.
