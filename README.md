A CC-Tweaked thing. Has basic directory management (cd, ls) and incomplete file manipulation (edit). Anonymous sign-in has no missing features as of now; you don't need to stalk the code for the username.
This code will *only* work in CC, don't bother trying in regular Lua.
When the activity that I made this for ends, I'll work on getting this in a more general format as an "OS within an OS within a game". When *that* gets started on, I'll open up issues and go from there.
